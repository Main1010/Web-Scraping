# Web-Scraping
This project based on data science;

Description:
This data science project focuses on developing an AI-based news summarization application using a Large Language Model (LLM). The app aims to streamline the consumption of news by providing concise summaries of lengthy articles. By leveraging web-scraping techniques, the app collects news articles from various sources across the internet. The LLM then processes the extracted text, identifying key points and generating coherent, brief summaries that capture the essence of the articles.
The main features of this project include:
1. Automated Web-Scraping: Collects and updates news articles from multiple sources.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes LLM to analyze and understand the content.
3. Summarization: Produces short, informative summaries for quick reading.
4. User-Friendly Interface: Allows users to easily browse and read summarized news.

Timestamp: This project was done during my field work course of computer science and engineering.
